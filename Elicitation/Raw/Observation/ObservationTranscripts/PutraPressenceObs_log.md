Hello I'm Hazard from TT5L Group 1 and I'm here observing the Butcher presence application.

0:11
It's an application that is used to record the student attendance by using QR code and giving a time of what they have been doing throughout the year.

0:22
So I have it on my mobile phone, which is I'm sharing right now and you have a couple of tabs that you can see at the bottom.

0:30
There's dashboard action record and profile.

0:34
So if you go to the first one action, you'll be presented by Let me go this way by the total events, you have a total, total number of friends events you've been to, total meetings, total workshop, total training conference and total number of seminars.

0:52
All of them are 0 because I just created an account.

0:55
So, but if you do attend, if you do attend any of, of, of of those meetings in, in theory it should increase number .1.

1:06
If you go over to action, you have, you have the option to click and see the invitations that you've got and you can scan an event code too using it will access your camera.

1:19
Yeah, yeah, you should be able to scan the QR code and accept invitation.

1:30
Let me go back over here.

1:37
It will just show you the attendance record of every of every event you've been to.

1:43
And finally, we have the profile where you can edit all of your profile.

1:47
I profile details and change whatever you need.

1:56
And yeah, that's about it looks like it.

2:04
There are also a bunch of sitting invitationalized privacy.

2:11
That's it for the person present system.

2:16
I think the idea of having an automated apps that manages all of your event invitation and keep keep a list of what what event you've been to, what events you want to go to or exit invitation is a great idea.

2:30
So we might implement that in our system.

2:32
And yeah, that's it.
