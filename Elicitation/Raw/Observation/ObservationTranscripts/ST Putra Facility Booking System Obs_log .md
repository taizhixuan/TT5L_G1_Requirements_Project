S Putra Facility Booking System Observation

0:02
Hello, my name is Hazim and I'm from TT5L Group One.

0:07
I will be observing the facility reservation system that you'll be able to provide where user can go and try to look for what they need and book it if they like it.

0:16
Luckily I do not need to be a member of the university or I need to log in to be able to use it as the system is open for everyone to use.

0:25
It takes 2 inputs, the type of the facility or the the aim or the purpose of why of what you're going to do with that venue.

0:33
So I'm going to click on the type of the facility.

0:35
The user will then be presented with a bunch of options, computer lab, ping pong, all of the available venue, venue criterias.

0:44
I'm going to click on a lecture room and show you how the system work.

0:47
So if I click fine, the system will provide real time searching and go grab all of the venues that that has the the criteria when you attach to it.

1:01
So after it does that searching, it will present me with all of the findings that could find.

1:06
And I get the name of the facility, the the amount that I need to pay per day to be it to, to book it.

1:13
And if I click on open, I will be presented with a picture of the venue, the details of the details of the venue, how many people it can fit, the size in meter square and the accommodation that it can come with too.

1:28
And there there was also an option to show the location of the venue using Google Maps, but I'm not really sure why it is not connecting to my browser.

1:39
So you can go and filter out what you, what you like and what you want to use.

1:46
After you find, after you find the venue that you wish to book, you can click on months over here and it will show you a whole, the whole, the calendar of the whole month.

1:57
If there's like, if there's someone else who book it or if there's any stability of a clash, If it's thread, then it means that it had already been booked and it should and it should try to find another day other than that date.

2:11
And if it's blue, then it's in the process of approval.

2:14
So the the other, the other input that it takes is the aim or the general purpose of the venue.

2:20
You can click on find and it will go and grab all of the, oh, I forgot to choose.

2:28
Yeah, I'm gonna click on meeting.

2:30
And now we wait for it to go and find all of the meeting venue that that UPM provide.

2:49
One of one of my findings is that when when you try to look for a venue using the generic criteria purpose, like it's a the purpose of the venue, it, it tends to take a lot of time to go and grab the result like from around 20 to 30 seconds.

3:08
And that is something that we should keep an eye on if you are going to implement this system in hours.

3:15
So looking at again the name of the facility, the price and the details about it, you can go through each one of them.

3:25
You can filter what you like.

3:27
And if you don't like it, you can you can book it and you can book it.

3:31
Yeah, that's about it for the UP UPM system, reservation system and yeah.
