Hello my name is Hazim and I'm from group from Group One TT 5 and I will be observing the kernel university event management system.

0:12
So campus group offer an integrated experience where club officers submit budget request, manage it also and publish an event where people can go and see and if they're interested and they can just apply to apply and say that they are going.

0:26
If it's full, it will tell him that's it the event is full and he cannot come.

0:30
And it will also and if the event is paid, it will also show them the price.

0:35
So here in the home, you will get like a work in Page.

0:38
They'll tell you everything about the page and in the dashboard you will be shown the upcoming event, if it's private, if it's opt in, if it's like an open where anyone can see the location and the date all of this will be will be shown.

0:52
And you can also see see the featured groups or clubs.

0:57
You can just go and click on one of them and it will take you to that is that group page, that group page where you can get all of the information about that specific group and so on.

1:09
Like, yeah, so let's go, let's go ahead and try to click on one of the open events and see where that takes us.

1:18
Yeah, you will be presented with the event page that has all of the details that will tell you everything you need about the event.

1:30
It even tells you how many people are just heading it right now.

1:35
You can go and click on new map to see where where the event take place.

1:40
And oh, oh, the V the V map feature apparently is not working.

1:48
But you can also add it to your calendar like like the system is linked to your Google Calendar if you wanted to or, or your outlook calendar, you can just click Add to calendar and it it it will automatically do that for you, which is a good feature in my opinion.

2:04
And yeah, you can even contact the organiser if you want to so in so in the contact page and see who hosted it and so on and go to the events tab and search what type of event you're looking for.

2:18
If it's up, it can then filter if it's upcoming or if it's past or who's who's doing that, that who's doing that event, the group type, the category tag.

2:29
All of these filter options are great and it will allow for much more flexibility.

2:35
And you don't even subscribe and get alerted when an event get or a group publishing event.

2:48
Sorry.

2:50
That's it for the campus group event management system.

3:00
Thank you.
