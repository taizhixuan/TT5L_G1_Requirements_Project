Hello again, I am haddam from Group One TT 5L and I will be observing the the campus lab event check in.

0:15
Unfortunately the app itself does not work on my device as I've tried to install it.

0:22
I needed an event key, which is the key that you get when you create an event so the other people who want to join or check in into that event can use it.

0:32
And if they use it, you'll get an e-mail and see who use it and so on.

0:36
I will explain more reading through the the Google Play page.

0:43
So as you can see from the screenshot, you will, you will, you will be asked to enter an event code when you begin using it.

0:51
After entering an event code, you will be shown the event page.

0:54
What, what, what it, what, what it's about hosted by who, the date and time, total number of attendees and the check in attendees.

1:05
So after you're done with, if you, if you're interested, you can check in and you, you'll get a list of who, who's going and who's not going and so on.

1:16
Yeah.

1:16
And that is basically it, which is again for it's an unfortunate thing that I could not get on my on my mobile phone, but I currently to the about and and according to the about page, Campus lab event checking is a companion app for campus labs which engage in student web applications that enable campus event host too easily and securely check students into event using mobile devices.

1:46
The app is for event host student and still and you don't need to download the app check in that event.

1:52
So you can just go and do it manually is always it's just a companion to east of which is what we want to do with our mobile companion for the university club management system.

2:07
And yeah, that's about it.

2:10
Again, it's very unfortunate that I cannot actually use it and show it to you or go through the system.

2:17
Well, the picture over here provide a sufficient or general idea of what it does, of what it does.

2:24
Yeah.

2:25
Thank you.
