Yeah, hello, my name is Haddam and I'm from TT5L Group One.

0:06
I will be observing the Eventbrite system.

0:08
Eventbrite is an, is an online automated club creation or event organized system where people who aren't interested in sharing the event with, with, with the world, they can just go to Eventbrite and register and then they could go and create event.

0:24
And for the other side of even while the, the user, the people who are interested in said event, they can go and look at an event that, that might interest, interest them.

0:36
And if they do like it, they can buy a ticket for it.

0:40
And if it's free, they can just go and attend it.

0:44
So I'm gonna look at, for example, nightlife in, in Malaysia.

0:49
It will show me all of the upcoming events in, for example, unconscious gathering this June at 9:00 PM and tickets go for 99 ringgit.

1:02
So if you click on it, you will you will be taken to that event link where you could see all of the all of the details and the requirement that you need to access the event.

1:20
Yeah, that's mostly it.

1:24
There are also other feature like trending events and events that you might be interested in.

1:30
And you could could also go for online events.

1:34
That's if you, if the event is online, you can just access it remotely from anywhere.

1:39
It'll work.

1:41
And all of them, oh, some of them even paint.

1:43
That's interesting.

1:45
But yeah.

1:46
And if you are an organizer, you can go to create event, it will and it will take you to the organiser page where you would go for it will take you to this page where you can get started and create your own event.

1:59
There are even guides and templates for you that would help help you greatly in managing and organising your own event and selling tickets and so on.

2:08
Even the pricing they have a they have a page for pricing to show you what you need to do and how you should price your tickets.

2:16
And yeah.

2:31
So in in general Eventbrite dominates public event management with user friendly RSVP flow and automated E tickets.

2:41
Which can be really good for a system like ours because let's say you want to manage an event remotely or you want to create an event easily using a wizard or or something like that.

2:53
People would expect it from our system and it would help really too.

2:57
So having automated reminders for events and and copying event by single click RSVP and calendar invite attachment could significantly boost power Club event turn out.

3:13
And that's it for Eventbrite.
